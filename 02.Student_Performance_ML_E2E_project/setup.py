# find_packages : this is responsible to finds the directories with __init__ and make it as package 
# setup : this is responsible to set up the information about the package we are creating.

# install_requires : i want all the packages we have installed in the dir will automatically fetched 
# and show in list form...for that we need to make a function get_requirements and pass 'requirements.txt' there.
# And to get everything in list form use List from typing..

# By introducing -e . in requirements.txt and install it...we can directly install setup.py too.
# Since in requirements.txt the -e . is not the package name so we need to ignore it and for that we will introduce some code here.
