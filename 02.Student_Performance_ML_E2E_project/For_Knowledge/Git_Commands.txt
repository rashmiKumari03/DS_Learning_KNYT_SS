Here's a summary of how to push and pull changes from Git:

1.Pushing Changes:
    - Add Changes: Use git add . to add the changes you want to commit.
    - Commit Changes: Commit the changes with git commit -m "Your commit message".
    - Push Changes: Push the committed changes to the remote repository with git push origin branch_name.

2.Pulling Changes:
    - Fetch Changes: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository with git fetch origin.
    - Merge Changes: Merge the fetched changes into your local branch using git merge origin/branch_name or git pull origin branch_name.
3.Additional Notes:
    - Replace branch_name with the appropriate branch name (master, main, or any other branch).
    - Always resolve any merge conflicts that may occur during the pull operation.
    - Review your changes before committing and pushing them to the remote repository.
    - Pull changes from the remote repository before pushing your own changes to avoid conflicts.
